  title: "Who am I?"
  content: 
    <p class="lead">
    <strong>I love nature and that's why I'm a Trail Runner.</strong> My passion is tecnology and new waves of ML. But, when I am not running or
    studying, I enjoy cooking and spend time with my relatives. 
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    <strong>My area of  interest</strong> is ML learning and industrial technologies. 
    Me and my 7-mates group try to solve teh most of the project that all the professors assignt to us
    always having in mind that always there's a other way.
    I enjoy learning and helping other to give their best and also, find me better me.
